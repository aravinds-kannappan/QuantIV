# Processed Options Data

This directory contains cleaned and validated options data ready for machine learning analysis.

## Data Processing Pipeline

Our processing pipeline applied the following transformations to the raw options data:

### Quality Control Filters
- **Strike Price Validation**: Removed options with unrealistic strike prices
- **Implied Volatility Bounds**: Filtered IV values to 1%-1000% annual range
- **Bid-Ask Spread Limits**: Excluded contracts with spreads >50% of mid-price
- **Volume Thresholds**: Required minimum trading activity over 5-day periods
- **Missing Data Handling**: Forward-fill for prices, mode imputation for categoricals

### Feature Engineering
- **Moneyness Calculation**: `ln(Underlying_Price / Strike_Price)`
- **Time Decay Metrics**: Days to expiration and annualized time ratios  
- **Greeks Computation**: Delta, gamma, theta, vega via Black-Scholes
- **Spread Analysis**: Bid-ask spread relative to option mid-price
- **Volume Ratios**: Contract volume relative to 20-day moving averages
